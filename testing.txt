Unit Tests: 
 1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

        A. Expect the multiplication(num1, num2) to be a a number
        B. Expect Multiplication(5, 6) to equal 30
        C. Expect Multiplication(2, -5) to equal -10
        D. Expect Multiplication(5, 0) to equal 0
        E. Expect Multiplication(-4, -3) to equal 12
        F. Expect Multiplication('5', 6) to throw an error 
        G. Expect Multiplication(2.5, 3) to equal 7.5
        H. Expect Multiplication(3.5, 6.5) to equal 22.75
        I. Expect Multiplication(1, 12) to equal 12
        J. Expect Multiplication(0, 0) to equal 0
        

2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. 
   It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, 
   from both of the arrays.

        A. Expect concatOdds('Hello', [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) to throw an error
        B. Expect concatOdds(12, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) to throw an error
        C. Expect concatOdds(['1', '3', '6', '9'], [1, '4', 7. 9. 11]) to throw error
        D. Expect concatOdds([], []) to throw an error 
        E. Expect concatOdds([1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 1, -2], [1, 2, 6, -2]) to return [-2, 1, 5, 7, 9, 11]
        F. Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [1, 3, 2, 5, 9]) to return [1, 3, 5, 9]
        G. Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [2, 4, 6]) to return []
        H. Expect concatOdds([1, 3, 7, 9, 0]) to throw an error
        I. Expect concatOdds([2.5, 2.75, 3.5, 7.6], [3.25, 7.6, 5.3, 3.5]) to throw an error  (decimals are not odd or even)
        J. Expect concatOdds([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]) to return []

Functional Test: 
1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), 
   or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account

        F. When user clicks 'cart' button, all item names, quantity, unit price, 
           and total price is listed for each item, and total cost off all items.
